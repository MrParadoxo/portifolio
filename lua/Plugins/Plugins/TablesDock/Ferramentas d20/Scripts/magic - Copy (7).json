Touch spells, effect spells, and area spells that affect you cannot be absorbed. Once the spell is cast, you can absorb 1d4+6 spell levels (rolled secretly by the DM). The level of each spell you absorb is subtracted from the total. If a spell is only partially absorbed (because its level exceeds the number of levels remaining to be absorbed), divide the number of spell levels left unabsorbed by the original spell level. For spells that deal damage, use the result to determine what fraction of the damage you take. For spells that create effects, use the result as a percentage chance to be affected.\n\nFor example, you have three spell levels of absorption remaining and are struck by dominate person (cast as a 5th-level spell). Absorption absorbs three levels of the spell, resulting in a 40% chance (2/5) that you will be affected normally. \n\nIf affected, any saving throw the spell allows you still applies. Likewise, if you're struck by disintegrate (cast as a 6th-level spell) with four levels of absorption remaining, two levels of the spell remain, and you take only 33% (2/6) of the damage you would normally take from the spell. You can use captured spell energy to cast any spell you know or have prepared, but spells so cast don't disappear from your list of prepared spells or count against the number of spells you can normally cast per day (so you so must keep a running total of spell levels absorbed and used).\n\nThe levels of spell energy you have stored must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell you want to cast, and you must have at hand (and expend) any material components required for the spell.",

You can concentrate on controlling the waterspout's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing the waterspout's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The waterspout always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends.\n\nThe waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up. Any creature or object that comes in contact with the waterspout must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage. Medium or smaller creatures who fail their save are sucked into the spout and held suspended in its powerful currents, taking 2d6 points of damage each round with no save allowed. Trapped creatures remain inside for 1d3 rounds before the waterspout ejects them out the top of the spout, and they fall back to the surface (taking falling damage) 1d8x5 feet from the base of the waterspout.\n\nWaterborne creatures or objects within 10 feet of the spout (below and on all sides) also must make successful Reflex saves or be sucked into the spout if they are Medium or smaller. Anything sucked into the spout takes 3d8 points of damage and is then trapped for 1d3 rounds as explained above.\n\nOnly the smallest canoes, kayaks, or coracles can be sucked into the spout. The occupant of any such craft may make a Profession (sailor) check instead of a Reflex save (his choice) to avoid being sucked up.",

    "description": "By infusing the nearby landscape with power stolen from the Plane of Shadow, you make the surrounding terrain a more savage, dangerous place.\nThe spell's exact effects vary with the terrain upon which it is cast.\nDesert: Shadow landscape transforms a desert into a place where no one goes willingly.\nThe average temperature increases by 30 degrees, or decreases by 30 degrees if the desert is actually a tundra (see Cold Dangers and Heat Dangers, pages 302-303 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\nSandstorms (or snowstorms if in a tundra) blow through a shadow landscape desert on an hourly basis.\nForest: Forests augmented with a shadow landscape spell become frightening places where a canopy of rotting leaves blocks the sun and all the trees are strangely twisted.\nSpaces with light undergrowth have heavy undergrowth\ninstead, and spaces covered with heavy undergrowth grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (Reflex partial at the shadow landscape's DC).\nHill: Even gentle hills become more treacherous under the effects of a shadow landscape spell.\nLight undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain under the effects of shadow landscape, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate.\nIt takes two squares to move uphill on a gradual slope, and four squares to move uphill on a steep slope.\nCliffs have frequent overhangs and are made of crumbling rock, requiring a DC 25 Climb check to ascend or descend.\nMarsh:Marshes seem swampier and more forbidding.\nHalf the undergrowth spaces in the marsh become quicksand (described on page 88 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\nMountain: The mountains become places of jagged peaks, slippery slopes, and howling winds.\nCliffs and chasms require a DC 25 Climb check to scale.\nCreatures who fail Climb checks or make loud noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (described on page 90 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\nAltitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category,\nand anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.\nPlain:Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent.\nHalf the spaces with undergrowth (light or heavy) grasp at passersby as if an entangle spell had been cast on them (Reflex partial at the shadow landscape's DC).\nUnderground:Ordinary dungeons aren't affected by shadow landscape, but naturally occurring caverns are.\nNatural stone floors take 4 squares of movement per space to enter.\nStalagmites cover 10% of the available floor space.\nIn addition to the terrain-specific effects, the shadow landscape spell worsens the weather within the spell's area.\nWhen rolling random weather on Table 3-23 in the Dungeon Master's Guide (or a similar table specific to the local area), roll twice and take the higher result.\nIn plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result.\nDon't roll random weather underground.\nYou don't suffer the terrain-specific effects (entangling terrain, hindrances to movement, altitude effects, higher Climb DCs, and so on) of a shadow landscape you've created.\nWhen you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler.\nCreatures so designated don't suffer the terrain-specific effects of the shadow landscape spell, but they're still subject to the bad weather.\nYou can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell's area as shadow guardians of the landscape.\nYou can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like.\nFor example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians.\nAs long as the designated guardians remain within the spell's area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you've designated, and also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision 60 ft.; damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and low-light vision.\nIf the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.",
