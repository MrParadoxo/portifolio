If the waterspout encounters insufficient depth after it has formed, it collapses.\n\nThe waterspout moves at a speed of 30 feet and must remain over water. You can concentrate on controlling the waterspout's every movement or specify a simple program, such as move straight ahead, zigzag, circle, or the like. Directing the waterspout's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The waterspout always moves during your turn in the initiative order. If the waterspout exceeds the spell's range, it collapses and the spell ends.\n\nThe waterspout batters creatures and objects it touches, and it often sucks them up. Any creature or object that comes in contact with the waterspout must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d8 points of damage.
