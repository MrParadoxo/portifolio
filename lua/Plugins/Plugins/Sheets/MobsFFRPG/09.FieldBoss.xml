			Texto="Field Effects are special Abilities that allow a monster to change the nature of the immediate battlefield to seal a party's powers or otherwise inconvenience them. A Field Effect takes a single Action to deploy. Its effects only harm the PCs and their allies; the only way to stop an Effect is by defeating the monster that deployed it. Because Field Effects can have a drastic impact on combat difficulty, it is recommended that they be restricted to Boss monsters and creatures summoned through Alarm or Slave Parts. Only one Field Effect may be active at any one time even if multiple monsters can use them, though the current Field Effect can be changed by expending an Action to deploy a new Effect.." />

			Texto="A powerful magnetic field dominates the area, weighing down any combatant with metallic equipment. \n Characters wearing Mail, Helmets, Shields, or Gauntlets are afflicted with the Status Condition Slow, even if they would normally be immune to it; \n the same applies to characters wielding any Weapon other than Boomerangs, Bows, Flails, Gloves, Rods or Staves. Slow cannot be canceled for as long as Magnetic Field remains active."/>

			Texto="For protection’s sake, the monster surrounds itself with doppelgangers, taking safety in numbers. \n A Decoy is entirely identical in appearance to the monster it replicates; not even a Scan Spell would be able to find a difference between the two. \n For this reason, Decoys are treated as a separate targets in combat, though they have no HP of their own and may make no Actions; the only way to destroy them is to eliminate their 'parent.' \n The Decoy's effects depend on how the Party direct its attacks. If the original monster is hit, it will take damage as normal, but striking a Decoy will result in an immediate counterattack; the monster itself suffers no ill effects. This attack takes the form of a Reaction Ability that must be assembled and paid for separately from the Decoy. XP and Gil values are given per Decoy assigned; a monster with three Decoys would incur XP and Gil modifiers of +60 and +75 respectively." />

			<basicAbility Top = "050" Name="Slave Part" field="bossSlave" 
			Texto="Some bosses in the Final Fantasy games are so large that they are actually composed of multiple parts. \n In the FFRPG, this is simulated by giving a Boss Slave Parts. \n A Slave Part is created as if it were an individual monster with the Slave Part Ability, and is treated as an individual combatant with its own Initiative in combat. \n However, it cannot move under its own power – it moves where the Boss moves. \n Slave Parts are incapacitated as normal when they are reduced to 0 HP, though they award no Gil or Experience when defeated; instead, the XP and Gil values of a Boss's Slave Parts are added to the Boss's own. \n When the Boss is reduced to 0 HP, all of its Slave Parts are also reduced to 0 Hit Points, regardless of current HP, ARM, or M. ARM. Slave Parts come in three types:" />
